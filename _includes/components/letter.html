      <p class="italic">Fellow technology leader,</p>
      <p>As the world’s foremost expert on env files — and the creator of the original <a target="_blank" href="https://npmjs.com/dotenv" class="link-primary">dotenv</a> (now installed billions of times a year) — I’ve spent over a decade helping developers manage secrets simply and safely.</p>
      <p>But the threat landscape has changed. Today, env files are critical infrastructure: embedded in AI agents, shipped with CI pipelines, and scattered across developer laptops. And yet — they remain unencrypted, unaudited, and often invisible to security teams.</p>
      <p>Dotenv Enterprise solves this.</p>
      <p>We’ve extended the familiar env file format to support encryption at rest, git-based auditing, and org-wide visibility — all without changing how developers work. It’s zero-friction security for an overlooked but essential layer of your stack.</p>
      <p>Please <a href="mailto:sm@dotenv-enterprise.com" class="link-primary">get in touch</a>. We have complete solutions and services available. This new technology is exciting! Major forward thinking organizations have implemented it, and we'd love to help you do the same.</p>
      <p>Regards,</p>
